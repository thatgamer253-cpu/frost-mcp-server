# Instructions for an automation workflow in Zapier or n8n.
# This example assumes automating a task to trigger on a new email
# and adding a task in a project management tool.

1. **Trigger**: New Email Received
   - Application: Email by Zapier or IMAP
   - Event: New Email

2. **Filter** (Optional): Check if the email is from a specific sender or has specific keywords.
   - Use Zapier filters or n8n IF node to ensure only relevant emails trigger further actions.

3. **Action**: Create a Task in Project Management Tool
   - Application: Asana, Trello, or another supported tool
   - Event: Create Task
   - Include details from the email such as subject as task title and body as the task description.

4. **Notification** (Optional): Send a confirmation email or Slack message.
   - Application: Gmail or Slack
   - Event: Send Email or Send Direct Message
   - Notify the required parties that a new task has been automatically created.

5. **Test the Workflow**: Ensure that the automation triggers correctly and performs all actions as expected.

6. **Activate the Zap/Workflow**: Once testing is successful, turn on the workflow to run automatically.
