# Proof of Concept for an Applied AI Engineer role with a focus on Python, Scraping, and AI

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Step 1: Web Scraping - Scrape LinkedIn job postings

def scrape_job_postings(url):
    # Send a GET request to the job postings page
    response = requests.get(url)
    # Parse the response content with BeautifulSoup
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    
    # Example: Extract job titles and descriptions
    job_titles = soup.find_all('h2', class_='job-title')  # Adjust the class to match the actual HTML structure
    job_descriptions = soup.find_all('div', class_='job-description')  # Adjust the class to match the actual HTML structure
    
    # Combine titles and descriptions for analysis
    job_texts = [title.get_text() + ": " + desc.get_text() for title, desc in zip(job_titles, job_descriptions)]
    
    return job_texts

# Step 2: Feature Extraction using TF-IDF

def extract_features(job_texts):
    # Instantiate the TF-IDF vectorizer
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
    
    # Fit and transform the job texts to get the TF-IDF matrix
    tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(job_texts)
    
    return tfidf_matrix, vectorizer

# Step 3: Clustering using K-Means

def cluster_jobs(tfidf_matrix, num_clusters=5):
    # Instantiate the K-Means model
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=num_clusters, random_state=42)
    
    # Fit the model to the TF-IDF matrix and predict job clusters
    kmeans.fit(tfidf_matrix)
    
    # Return the labels of the clusters
    return kmeans.labels_

# Usage

# URL for LinkedIn job postings (example placeholder, replace with actual URL)
job_postings_url = 'https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?keywords=Applied%20AI%20Engineer'

# Scrape job postings
job_texts = scrape_job_postings(job_postings_url)

# Extract TF-IDF features
tfidf_matrix, vectorizer = extract_features(job_texts)

# Cluster job postings
job_clusters = cluster_jobs(tfidf_matrix)

# Output the cluster labels for each job position
for job, cluster in zip(job_texts, job_clusters):
    print(f"Job: {job}\nCluster: {cluster}\n")
