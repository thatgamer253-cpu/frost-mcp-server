# This Python script serves as a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a basic web scraping and AI analysis task.
# It demonstrates how to extract data from a webpage, process it, and derive insights using a simple AI model.

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Define a URL to scrape
URL = "https://exampleblog.com"

# Send a request to the website and obtain content
response = requests.get(URL)
content = response.content

# Parse the content with BeautifulSoup
soup = BeautifulSoup(content, 'html.parser')

# Extract all text content from paragraph tags in article section
paragraphs = soup.find_all('p')
text_content = [p.get_text() for p in paragraphs]

# Combine all text data into a single string for vectorization
text_data = " ".join(text_content)

# Utilize TfidfVectorizer to transform text data
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X = vectorizer.fit_transform([text_data])

# Apply a simple KMeans clustering to identify content topics
n_clusters = 2  # Example: set to 2 for simplicity, can be parameterized
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters, random_state=42)
kmeans.fit(X)

# Output the centroid details indicating text grouping insights
print("Cluster Centers:\n", kmeans.cluster_centers_)
print("Labels:\n", kmeans.labels_)

# The labels represent which cluster each text item in 'text_content' belongs to
# This PoC demonstrates scraping and basic AI/ML application for data insights.
