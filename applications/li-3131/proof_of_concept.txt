# Import required libraries
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Function to scrape job descriptions from a webpage

    response = requests.get(url)
    # Parse the HTML content with BeautifulSoup
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

    descriptions = soup.find_all(class_='job-desc')
    # Extract text content
    job_texts = [desc.get_text() for desc in descriptions]

    # Calculate cosine similarity between skill description and each job
    similarity_scores = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix[-1], tfidf_matrix[:-1])
    # Return similarity scores

# Example usage workflow

    # Match job to skills using AI
