# This PoC demonstrates a simple AI-enhanced web scraping script using Python.
# Libraries required: requests, BeautifulSoup, and an AI text analysis tool like transformers.

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from transformers import pipeline

# Define the URL to scrape
url = 'https://www.example.com/articles'

# Send an HTTP request to the URL
response = requests.get(url)

# Parse the page content using BeautifulSoup
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

# Extract article titles and links - adjust the selectors based on the website structure
articles = soup.find_all('div', class_='article')

# Initialize an AI sentiment analysis pipeline
sentiment_analyzer = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')

# Create a list to store the processed article information
processed_articles = []

# Loop through the extracted articles
for article in articles:
    title = article.find('h2').text
    link = article.find('a')['href']
    
    # Assuming the article content can be extracted from its page
    article_response = requests.get(link)
    article_soup = BeautifulSoup(article_response.text, 'html.parser')
    content = article_soup.find('div', class_='content').text
    
    # Run sentiment analysis on the article content
    sentiment = sentiment_analyzer(content[:512])  # Analyze the first 512 characters for demonstration
    
    processed_articles.append({
        'title': title,
        'link': link,
        'sentiment': sentiment
    })

# Print the processed articles with sentiment information
for processed in processed_articles:
    print(f"Title: {processed['title']}, Link: {processed['link']}, Sentiment: {processed['sentiment']}")

# Note: Make sure to respect the website's scraping policy and adjust content extraction accordingly.
