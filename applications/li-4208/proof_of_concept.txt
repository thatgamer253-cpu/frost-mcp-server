This script serves as a starting point for scraping job listings and applying AI analysis to summarize job roles and responsibilities. Adjustments to HTML parsing might be necessary based on the actual structure of LinkedIn's web pages and compliance with LinkedIn's Terms of Service. Always ensure ethical considerations and legal compliance when scraping data.
