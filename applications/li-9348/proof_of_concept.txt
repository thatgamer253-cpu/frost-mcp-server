This Python script is a functional template that demonstrates how to web-scrape job postings from LinkedIn (assuming placeholder structure), extract textual features using TF-IDF, and apply KMeans clustering to group similar job descriptions. Make sure to adjust the selectors and job URL according to the actual LinkedIn page structure.
