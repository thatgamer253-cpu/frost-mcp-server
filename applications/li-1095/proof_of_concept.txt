# Requirement: Automation (Zapier/n8n)
# PoC: Workflow steps for automating a process using n8n 
    
1. **Trigger Node**: Set up a "Webhook" trigger to initiate the workflow whenever a new data entry is received.

2. **HTTP Request Node**: Add an HTTP Request node to fetch data from a specified external API.
   - **Method**: GET
   - **URL**: https://api.example.com/data

3. **Function Node**: Use a JavaScript function to transform or filter the received data as required.
   - Example: Filter data to exclude entries older than a certain date.
   - Use `new Date()` to get current date and filter logic for custom filtering.

4. **IF Node**: Branch the workflow based on simple condition logic.
   - Condition: Check if the filtered data length is greater than zero.

5. **Email Node**: If the condition is true, send an email notification with the filtered data.
   - **Email Service**: Gmail
   - **To**: user@example.com
   - **Subject**: "Filtered Data Available"
   - **Body**: Include JSON formatted data

6. **Finish the workflow**: Ensure all branches are synced and close the process by ensuring success or failure paths conclude the flow management.
