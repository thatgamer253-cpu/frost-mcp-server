# If the task requires automation (e.g., Zapier/n8n), outline the workflow steps.

1. Trigger: New Job Posted on LinkedIn

2. Action: Extract Job Data
   - Define an API or scraping process to extract the job title, description, and apply link.

3. Action: Store Data in a Database or Spreadsheet
   - Use a storage service like Google Sheets, Airtable, or a database to save the details of each job.

4. Action: Send Notification
   - Implement a notification mechanism using an email service (SMTP, SendGrid) or messaging app (Slack, Teams).

5. Action: Log Entry to Track Automation
   - Maintain logs of each automation run, capturing successes or any errors encountered, for monitoring and troubleshooting.
