# This is a Python script template for an Applied AI Engineer role focusing on web scraping and simple AI processing.
# It uses the BeautifulSoup library for scraping and implements a basic sentiment analysis using TextBlob (both require installation).

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
from textblob import TextBlob

# URL of the website to scrape
url = "https://example.com/articles"

# Send a request to fetch the HTML content of the page
response = requests.get(url)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Parse the HTML using BeautifulSoup
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    
    # Example: Extract all article titles from the webpage
    titles = soup.find_all('h2', class_='article-title')

    # Loop through each title and perform sentiment analysis
    for title in titles:
        title_text = title.get_text()
        print(f"Title: {title_text}")

        # Perform sentiment analysis using TextBlob
        analysis = TextBlob(title_text)
        print(f"Sentiment: {analysis.sentiment}\n")
else:
    print("Failed to retrieve the webpage")

# Note:
# - To run this script, install the required packages using pip: 
#   pip install beautifulsoup4 requests textblob
# - The URL and HTML selectors (`h2.article-title`) need to be adapted to the specific site structure you are working with.
# - This is a basic example for demonstration purposes. Error handling, dynamic selectors, cookies, headers, etc., should be implemented based on real use cases.

# API Routers in a SaaS/Web Python application using FastAPI
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException

app = FastAPI()

# In-memory storage for demonstration (use a database in production)
users_data = {}

@app.get("/user/{user_id}")
async def read_user(user_id: int):
    # Fetch a user by user_id
    if user_id in users_data:
        return {"user_id": user_id, "data": users_data[user_id]}
    else:
        # Raise a 404 error if user is not found
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="User not found")

@app.post("/user/")
async def create_user(user_id: int, data: dict):
    # Create or update a user with the given user_id
    users_data[user_id] = data
    return {"message": "User created successfully", "user_id": user_id}

# Note:
# - This is a basic demonstration of creating API routes using FastAPI.
# - Replace the in-memory store with persistent storage for production use.
# - Use authentication and validation to secure the endpoints.

# This is an automation workflow using n8n to automate the data collection and notification process
Workflow Steps for n8n:
1. **HTTP Request Node:**
   - Configure to send GET request to `https://example.com/data` every hour.
   - Collects and outputs JSON data structure.
   
2. **IF Node:**
   - Condition: Check if the JSON response contains new updates or relevant information.
   - Example condition: `{{ $json["newData"] != null }}`

3. **Set Node (true path):**
   - Prepare a message template that includes new data details.
   - Example: "New update detected: {{ $json["newData"] }}"

4. **Email Node:**
   - Configuration:
     - Receiver's Email: example@domain.com
     - Subject: "New Update Notification"
     - Message: Use the output from the Set Node for the email body.

5. **False Path:**
   - Add a NoOp Node for no action or log the message "No new updates".

# Note:
# - Ensure proper authentication is in place for API requests and email service.
# - Customize node configurations, conditions, and placeholders based on specific use-case requirements.
