- Trigger: A new job posting is added to a specified RSS feed or API endpoint.
- Action 1: Use a "Fetch Data" node to retrieve job details from the RSS feed/endpoint.
- Action 2: Use a "Format Data" node to parse and clean the job information.
- Action 3: If specific job criteria are met (e.g., remote, specific title/keywords), proceed; use a "Filter" node for this condition.
- Action 4: Use an HTTP Request node to post this information to a Slack channel or email for notifications.
- Action 5: Store formatted job results to a Google Sheet or database for record-keeping.

# Note: Utilize SEO-friendly titles, descriptions, and ensure webhook or API permissions are configured.
