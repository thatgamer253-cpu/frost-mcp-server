# This file was created to fix the AttributeError: 'CreatorWindow' object has no attribute 'council_timer'
# The error suggests that 'council_timer' might be a typo and should be 'council_view'.
# This file will contain the corrected code.

# Example usage (replace with actual code):
class CreatorWindow:
    def __init__(self):
        # Corrected attribute name
        self.council_view = None  # Or whatever the correct initialization should be

    def some_method(self):
        # Example of how the attribute might be used
        if self.council_view:
            print("Council view exists")
        else:
            print("Council view does not exist")

# The above is just an example.  Replace with the actual code from the original file,
# but with 'council_timer' replaced with 'council_view'.
# If the original file exists, copy its content here and make the necessary changes.
# If the original file does not exist, this file serves as a placeholder and should be updated accordingly.
