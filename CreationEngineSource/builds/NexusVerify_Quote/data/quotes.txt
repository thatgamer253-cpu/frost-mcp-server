The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
Believe you can and you're halfway there.
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
It always seems impossible until it's done.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.
The best way to predict the future is to create it.
Your time is limited, don't waste it living someone else's life.
Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value.
The mind is everything. What you think you become.
What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals.
