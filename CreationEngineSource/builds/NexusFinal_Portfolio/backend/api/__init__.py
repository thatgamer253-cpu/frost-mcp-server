"""
Initializes the api directory as a Python package.

This file can be left empty, or contain package-level initialization code.
For a simple FastAPI application, it often remains empty, as routers are
typically imported and included in the main application instance.

# Any package-level imports or configurations for the API can be added here if needed.
# For example, if you had common API-wide middleware or dependencies that
# applied to all API versions, they could be defined or imported here.
