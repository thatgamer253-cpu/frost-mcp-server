"""
Initializes the endpoints directory as a Python package.

This file can be left empty, or contain package-level initialization code
specific to the API endpoints. For a typical FastAPI application, it often
remains empty, as individual endpoint routers are imported and included
in `backend/api/v1/api.py`.
"""
# Any package-level imports or configurations for the endpoints can be added here if needed.
# For example, if there were common dependencies or middleware that applied
# to all endpoints within this directory, they could be defined or imported here.
