Initializes the v1 API version directory as a Python package.

This file can be left empty, or contain package-level initialization code
specific to API version 1. For a typical FastAPI application, it often
remains empty, as routers are imported and included in `backend/api/v1/api.py`.
"""
# Any package-level imports or configurations for API v1 can be added here if needed.
# For example, if there were common dependencies or middleware that applied
# only to v1 endpoints, they could be defined or imported here.
