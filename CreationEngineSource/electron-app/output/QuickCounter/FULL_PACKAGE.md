# 📦 Consolidated Package: count_with_delay

*Generated by Overlord on 2026-02-15 02:47:28*

## 🎯 Project Overview

The project "count_with_delay" is a standalone Python script designed for users who need a simple program to count from 1 to 10 with a delay between each number. It is built using Python 3.11+ and leverages the `time` module to introduce delays, with the script being executable from the command line. To install and run it, simply execute the command `python main.py` in the terminal.

## 🔧 Environment Setup

```bash
mkdir count_with_delay && cd count_with_delay
python main.py
```

## 💻 Source Code

### `main.py`
```python
import time

def count_to_ten():
    try:
        for number in range(1, 11):
            print(number)
            time.sleep(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    count_to_ten()
```

### `README.md`

# README

## Overview

This script contains a function `count_to_ten()` which counts from 1 to 10 with a delay between each number. It is designed to demonstrate a simple counting mechanism with a time delay.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Clone the repository to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the repository.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

   Replace `<project-directory>` with the actual directory name.

3. **Run the Script:**

   Execute the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will start the counting process, displaying numbers from 1 to 10 with a delay between each number.

## Error Handling

The script is designed to handle potential errors gracefully. If an error occurs during execution, it will be caught and an appropriate message will be displayed.

## Notes

- Ensure that your Python environment is correctly set up and that you have the necessary permissions to execute scripts.
- The script uses the `time` module to introduce delays between counts. Make sure this module is available in your Python installation.
