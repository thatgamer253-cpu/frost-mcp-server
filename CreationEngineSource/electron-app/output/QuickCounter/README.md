## Overview

This script contains a function `count_to_ten()` which counts from 1 to 10 with a delay between each number. It is designed to demonstrate a simple counting mechanism with a time delay.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Clone the repository to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the repository.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

   Replace `<project-directory>` with the actual directory name.

3. **Run the Script:**

   Execute the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will start the counting process, displaying numbers from 1 to 10 with a delay between each number.

## Error Handling

The script is designed to handle potential errors gracefully. If an error occurs during execution, it will be caught and an appropriate message will be displayed.

## Notes

- Ensure that your Python environment is correctly set up and that you have the necessary permissions to execute scripts.
- The script uses the `time` module to introduce delays between counts. Make sure this module is available in your Python installation.
