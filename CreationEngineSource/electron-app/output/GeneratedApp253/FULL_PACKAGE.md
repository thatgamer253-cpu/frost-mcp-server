# 📦 Consolidated Package: south_park_script_generator

*Generated by Overlord on 2026-02-15 07:34:21*

## 🎯 Project Overview

The South Park Script Generator is a Python application designed for fans and creators who want to generate scripts for South Park episodes, complete with AI-generated dialogue, plot, and character interactions. It utilizes technologies such as FastAPI, OpenAI, and TextBlob, with a modular architecture including files for characters, plot, dialogue, and formatting. To install and run the project, ensure all dependencies listed in 'requirements.txt' are installed, configure the environment variables as per '.env.example', and execute the command `python main.py`.

```bash
mkdir south_park_script_generator && cd south_park_script_generator
python -m venv venv
# Windows: venv\Scripts\activate  |  Unix: source venv/bin/activate
