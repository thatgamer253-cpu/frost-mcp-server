# South Park Episode Generator

## Project Description

The South Park Episode Generator is a Python application designed to create a South Park-style animated episode centered around the fictional release of the "Epstein Files." This application generates a short animated video complete with character voices, animations, and a storyline that humorously explores the chaos in South Park following the files' release.

### Features

1. **Character Animation**: Animated versions of South Park characters with basic movements like walking, talking, and gesturing using a 2D animation library.
2. **Voice Synthesis**: Distinct character voices generated using a text-to-speech library.
3. **Script Generation**: Humorous script generation based on the "Epstein Files" theme using natural language processing.
4. **Scene Composition**: Multiple scenes with background images and character placements, including smooth transitions.
5. **Sound Effects and Music**: Integration of background music and sound effects typical of South Park episodes.
6. **User Interface**: A simple GUI for inputting parameters like episode length, main plot points, and character focus.
7. **Export Functionality**: Export the generated episode as a video file (e.g., MP4).
8. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for missing assets, text-to-speech failures, and script generation errors.
